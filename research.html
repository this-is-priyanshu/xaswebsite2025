                <p class="paper-abstract">Stars, galaxies, and quasars help us understand the universe. While stars are plasma spheres, galaxies are vast systems of gas and dark matter, and quasars are distant, bright objects. Using SDSS data, this paper employs supervised machine learning and neural networks for classification. Our dense neural network yielded the best results in accuracy and speed, outperforming decision-tree-based methods.</p>

                <p class="paper-abstract">Astronomical imaging of star clusters is key to understanding stellar dynamics. This paper introduces a wavelet-based technique to denoise data from NGC 2301, captured at Fr. Eugene Lafont Observatory. Our approach uses an undecimated wavelet transform with modified thresholding to improve image quality, resulting in a significant increase in detected stars across RGB channels.</p>

                <p class="paper-abstract">Led by UG and PG students, this project developed a low-cost, Arduino-based radio telescope (12-18 GHz). The system successfully detected geostationary and non-geostationary satellites despite urban Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). It offers an affordable gateway for students to explore radio astronomy, with future plans for interferometric observations.</p>

                <p class="paper-abstract">From May to December 2023, FELO facilitated projects focusing on Observational Astronomy and Computational Astrophysics. Students observed solar flares, studied urban light pollution, and analyzed aerosol data. In Computational Astrophysics, projects included cosmological model constraining using Bayesian inference and gravitational wave data analysis. These initiatives highlight XAS's commitment to fostering a robust practical learning environment.</p>
